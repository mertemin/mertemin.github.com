I am a software engineer at Apple working on Maps. Check out my [**CV**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nkevmnbk49z2z6a/MertEminKalender_cv.pdf?dl=0).

##### Some more details about myself:
I like experimenting different ideas and see them action. So far I have developed, released and maintained several services using different technologies. Some of them are still live, some don't. For examples check my CV.

**The Next Move**

> My plan is to keep my focus on geospatial and backend services and improve my skills and expertise in these areas. I'd like be part of the teams consisting of passionate and hardworking people who work on products used by millions of users.


**Whatâ€™s Happening?**

> By day I am software engineer working on Apple Maps, by night a freelance researcher/developer working on various topics from distributed systems to crowdsourcing.
