I am a masters student at Bilkent University, Ankara. I have broad range of research interests, but mainly work on software engineering related topics. I read a lot, try to write open source recently. Here is my [CV](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36697720/docs/MertEminKalender_cv.pdf). More about myself is as follows:

**The Next Move**

> My plan is to complete masters degree in two to three semesters (between September 2013 and January 2014). <del>After completion, I am thinking to move abroad and look for a full time position where I can contribute with my abilities and simultaneously gain in terms of expertise and vision. I don’t have a real preference for location, but I am fully open to experience different cultures and ideas as long as I can learn and share with others.</del> I will join Microsoft as Software Development Engineer next October.


I am considering to learn new technologies and tools for future use. I have a few side projects in my mind, and I am thinking to create and release them soon. I will be focusing on open source.


**What’s Happening?**

> Right now I taking a break from freelancing. I am fully concentrating on my masters education about software engineering at [Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey](http://www.bilkent.edu.tr). While I am trying to deepen my knowledge and expertise in software engineering related topics, especially model driven development, simultaneously I spend some time on data structures, machine learning, computer architecture and keep my interests broad.
