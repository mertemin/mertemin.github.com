This is the first blog entry of my entire life, because I have always stayed away from blogging. It is common that you can find lots of blogs with a ‘Hello World’ post or even no posts at all. I saw people start blogging eagerly, but after a short while they even forget if they have a blog or not.

Despite the fact that there are good examples (you will probably see links to them in the future), I had generally considered bad ones, and resisted myself from blogging. However, until recently I have realized that I need one. I read a lot, and sometimes I need some safe place to keep interesting posts and maybe share my own ideas. Plus, a public blog might even be better for other people to benefit from it. As a result I created this blog, and here we are. **I hope this will be fun!**
