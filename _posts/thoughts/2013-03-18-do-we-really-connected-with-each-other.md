Today is one my of Facebook friends birthday. All day people congratulated him for the day of his birth. However, there is one problem. This person died last year, and only a few people are aware of that fact. The rest majority acted without a clue as if he is still alive.

Facebook’s entry page says that we can connect with friends and the world around us using it. But how come two people are connected with each other, become friends, and one is not aware of the fact that the other is death? This is sad, really sad showing an aspect of damaged social interactions happening online. For me all these congratulations, condolences, best-wishes are prefabricated. Degrading the whole social in-person interaction to a numb but decorated with smileys, sad faces statement does not seem genuine. So I mostly avoid these, although this may not be the best solution.

I think social media should be an alternative way to interact with people, but not the only way. I like the way social media enabling more sharing with others and expressing someone himself/herself with a text or song or video. However, I really don’t like the fake **social** interactions not to mention the online profiles, which has nothing to do with the real personality.

UPDATE
